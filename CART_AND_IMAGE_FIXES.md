# 🛒 Cart and Image Upload Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Shopping Cart Not Opening
- **Problem**: Cart icon click not working
- **Solution**: Replaced Sheet component with simple modal overlay
- **Added**: Debug logging to track cart state and clicks

### 2. Vendor Image Upload Failing
- **Problem**: Storage bucket 'products' doesn't exist
- **Solution**: Created storage bucket setup migration
- **Added**: Better error handling and fallback to data URLs

## 🔧 **Steps to Fix**

### **Step 1: Run Database Migrations**

Copy and paste these SQL scripts in your Supabase SQL Editor:

#### **A. Orders and Payments Tables**
```sql
-- Run the content of: supabase/migrations/20250124000002_create_orders_and_payments.sql
```

#### **B. Storage Buckets Setup**
```sql
-- Run the content of: supabase/migrations/20250124000003_create_storage_buckets.sql
```

### **Step 2: Test the Cart**

1. **Open the browser console** (F12 → Console tab)
2. **Go to `/products` page**
3. **Add a product to cart** - you should see console logs
4. **Click the cart icon** in the header - you should see:
   - "Cart clicked, opening cart" in console
   - Cart modal should open from the right side
5. **Check cart contents** - items should be visible

### **Step 3: Test Image Upload**

1. **Login as a vendor**
2. **Go to vendor dashboard**
3. **Click "Add Product"**
4. **Try uploading an image**
5. **Check console for detailed error messages**

## 🐛 **Debugging Cart Issues**

If the cart still doesn't work, check the browser console for:

### **Common Issues:**
1. **"useCart must be used within a CartProvider"**
   - Solution: Make sure App.tsx has `<CartProvider>` wrapper

2. **Cart state is empty but items were added**
   - Solution: Check localStorage in DevTools → Application → Local Storage
   - Look for key: `agriconnect-cart`

3. **Cart icon shows no count**
   - Solution: Check if `getItemCount()` returns correct number

### **Debug Commands in Console:**
```javascript
// Check cart in localStorage
localStorage.getItem('agriconnect-cart')

// Clear cart if needed
localStorage.removeItem('agriconnect-cart')
```

## 🖼️ **Debugging Image Upload Issues**

### **Check Storage Bucket:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
2. Look for `products` bucket
3. If missing, run the storage migration SQL

### **Common Upload Errors:**
1. **"Bucket not found"**
   - Run storage bucket migration
   - Check Supabase Storage dashboard

2. **"Permission denied"**
   - Check RLS policies in migration
   - Make sure user is authenticated

3. **"File too large"**
   - Check file is under 5MB
   - Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP

### **Fallback Behavior:**
- If upload fails, images are stored as data URLs
- This works for demo but not recommended for production
- Set up proper storage bucket for permanent solution

## 🎯 **Expected Results After Fixes**

### **Cart Functionality:**
✅ Cart icon shows item count badge  
✅ Clicking cart icon opens modal from right  
✅ Can add/remove items  
✅ Can update quantities  
✅ Cart persists across page refreshes  
✅ Can proceed to checkout  

### **Image Upload:**
✅ Can select image files  
✅ Image preview shows immediately  
✅ Upload progress and error messages  
✅ Images display in product listings  
✅ Fallback to data URL if storage fails  

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Run the migrations** to set up database tables and storage
2. **Test both cart and image upload** functionality
3. **Check browser console** for any remaining errors
4. **Let me know** if you encounter any issues
